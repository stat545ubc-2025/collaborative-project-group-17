### Hi there!

This project serves as an introduction to using and collaborating in GitHub, and is a deliverable for the **545A Exploratory Data Analysis class** at UBC (Fall 2025) âœ¨

Our team for this project: @smgarcia-bio, @dengbruh, @fatyas, @am-field

In the project folder, you can find three major files. 
- [X] This README.md file, explaining the project and its contents;
- [X] A teamwork contract, TEAMWORK.md, covering division of labor, communication, and timing of the project for both deliverables;
- [X] Two troubleshooting R markdown files (and their associated markdown files), which are assigned documents that came with errors for us to fix as part of this project.

If you'd like to run code that appears in this project, please use R/RStudio ðŸ˜Ž. Please complete all edits in your personal branch before merging them to the main repository via pull request.
