### Hi there!
This project serves as an introduction to using and collaborating in GitHub, and is a deliverable for the **545A Exploratory Data Analysis class** at UBC (Fall 2025) âœ¨
Our team for this project: @smgarcia-bio, @dengbruh, @fatyas, @am-field
In the project folder, you can find three major files. 
- [X] This README.md file, explaining the project and its contents;
- [X] A teamwork contract, TEAMWORK.md, covering division of labor, communication, and timing of the project;
- [X] A troubleshooting document, which is an assigned document that came with errors for us to fix as part of this project.
If you'd like to run code that appears in this project, please use R/RStudio :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
