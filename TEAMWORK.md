3. Communication:
   * We will communicate via Slack for urgent communications and Github issues for non-urgent communications, and will meet on **Thursdays** in person after class. In the event team members are unable to make meetings in person, they will ensure that they are available to be contacted via Slack messages during this time. For messages sent outside of meeting time, we will ensure to reply to them within 24 hours.
